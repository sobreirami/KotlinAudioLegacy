KotlinAudio is an Android audio player written in Kotlin, making it simpler to work with audio playback from streams and files.

Inspired by [SwiftAudio.](https://github.com/DoubleSymmetry/SwiftAudioEx) Our aim is to have feature parity with the iOS equivalent.

Currently a work in progress! More information soon.
